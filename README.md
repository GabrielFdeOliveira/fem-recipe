### What I learned

I frequently overlook HTML and CSS, drawn to the more "code-like" aspects of learning. However, whenever I consistently engage with these two technologies, I discover incredibly useful tools, such as these.

```css
#prep-time li::marker {
  color: #7e425c;
}
```

```css
#ingredients li {
  text-indent: 1.2em;
}
```

It's very convenient to precisely focus on how the text in a list interacts with its bullet points.

### Continued development

I couldn't quite figure out why I had to make the image bigger on mobile view to stretch it across the whole screen width. Maybe it had something to do with using "normalize.css". And yeah, I had to resort to using negative margins to get the image to stay where I wanted it, but honestly, I'm not sure why that worked either.
